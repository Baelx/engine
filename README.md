# Install and setup

1. Install Golang if you haven't already [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)

2. Set your GOPATH, [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH)

3. Add Go's _bin_ folder to your paths. More on that [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), or you can use:
`export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"`

4. Git clone the project into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/battlesnakeio/engine`. Note, the docs for GOPATH and project directory layouts can be found [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH).

# Running the engine

Build an excutable via `make install` and then run `engine server` to run a local version of the server.

**Better command**: `make run`

Note: if you use the Makefile, you'll want JQ installed, [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

## Running a game with the CLI

1. Setup a `snake-config.json`, by default the engine looks in the HOME directory (see make run-game in the Makefile)

Here's an example:

```
{
    "width": 20,
    "height": 20,
    "food": 10,
    "snakes": [
        {
            "name": "Snake 1",
            "url": "http://localhost:8080"
        },
        {
            "name": "Snake 2",
            "url": "http://localhost:3001"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Start the engine (refer above)

3. Start a game with `make run-game`

Example Output:
```
â‡’  make run-game
go install github.com/battlesnakeio/engine/cmd/engine
engine-cli run -g "d151fe9d-8c15-4d31-a932-e7b4248d5586"
```

4. To replay a game, run: `engine replay -g <game id>`


For more information about the engine:

`engine --help`

`engine [command] --help`

## Backend configuration

Storage options:

* `inmem` - This is the default. All game data is erased when the engine restarts.
* `file` - Stores one file per game. Games can be resumed or replayed after restart.

### Examples:

Save games as files in `~/battlesnake/`

```engine all --backend file --backend-args ~/battlesnake```
